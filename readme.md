# 🌡️ Daily Temperature Tracker
## 📌 Project Overview
The **Daily Temperature Tracker** is a Python-based program designed to help users record daily temperatures and calculate useful weekly statistics such as average, maximum, and minimum temperatures. It provides a simple, user-friendly way to monitor temperature trends over a week.
## 🎯 Goal
The main objective of this task is to:
- Create a Python program that tracks daily temperatures

- Store data using Python lists

- Implement functions to compute weekly statistics

- Present results in a clear and user-friendly format
## 🧩 Features
- Input daily temperature readings

- Store temperatures in a list
- Calculate:
    - Average temperature
    - Maximum temperature
    - Minimum temperature

- Display a weekly summary
## 🛠️ How It Works
###  1. Temperature Storage
- Daily temperatures are entered and stored in a Python list.
### 2. Weekly Calculations
- Functions are implemented to:
    - Calculate the average
    - temperature
    - Find the maximum temperature
    - Find the minimum temperature
### 3. Output
- Results are displayed in a neat and easy-to-read format for user convenience.

## 🧪 Example Output
<pre>```bash   Enter temperature for Day 1: 25
Enter temperature for Day 2: 27
Enter temperature for Day 3: 23
...
Enter temperature for Day 7: 26

📊 Weekly Temperature Summary:
- Average Temperature: 25.14°C
- Maximum Temperature: 29°C
- Minimum Temperature: 22°C </pre>

## 💻 Technologies Used
- Python (Standard Library)
## 🚀 Getting Started
1.  Clone the repository or download the script.

2. Run the Python file:

    ```bash
    python Temperature_Tracker.py

3. Enter the temperatures as prompted.

## 📚 Learning Objectives
This task helps reinforce key Python concepts such as:

- Lists and data storage
- Writing reusable functions
- Basic statistical calculations
- Console input/output handling

## ✅ Completion Criteria
- All 7 daily temperatures can be entered by the user
- Weekly average, min, and max are correctly calculated
- Output is displayed in a user-friendly format
